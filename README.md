# Titanic EDA Project

This repository contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

## Objectives:
1. Understand the distribution of numerical and categorical variables.
2. Detect missing values and handle them.
3. Visualize the relationship between different features and survival rates.
4. Detect outliers and analyze multicollinearity.

## Steps:
- Load and inspect the Titanic dataset.
- Perform summary statistics to get an overview of the data.
- Visualize key features with histograms, boxplots, and pairplots.
- Create a correlation matrix to identify multicollinearity.

## Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Files:
- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for analysis.
